### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


-   Iâ€™m currently completing a project-oriented, full-time training in MERN-stack technologies 
    at the Digital Career Institute in Berlin, while also working on my Google UX Design Professional Certificate!

-   I'm largely interested in the topic of mediation and accessibility; As a Visual Designer I have been working on design solutions that would render gallery         contexts more accessible to vistors. I am now looking to continue this kind of mediative work by creating userfriendly and accessible websites as a frontend       developer/ux designer.
